- 👋 Hi, I’m @ilya-at-prettyneat
- 👀 I’m interested in looking at stuff through googly eyes, apparently
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to edit my special README.md in the repository all about me
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything, as long as it requires 0 seconds (that's simply the sum of my free time)
- 📫 How to reach me - my username is a mangled email.
